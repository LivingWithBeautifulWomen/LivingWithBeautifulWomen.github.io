    <h1>One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez</h1>
    <p>Our story begins with Colonel Aureliano Buendía reflecting on the early years of Macondo, a secluded village founded by his father, José Arcadio Buendía. Macondo is isolated from the outside world, only occasionally visited by gypsies bringing technological marvels that captivate its inhabitants. José Arcadio Buendía, fascinated by these innovations, immerses himself in scientific study with supplies from Melquíades, the gypsies' leader. He becomes increasingly solitary in his quest for knowledge. Meanwhile, his wife, Úrsula Iguarán, is more practical and is frustrated by her husband's obsession.</p>
    <p>José Arcadio Buendía dreams of relocating Macondo to connect with civilization, but is thwarted by Úrsula's refusal to leave. He then focuses on his sons: José Arcadio, who has inherited his father's strength, and Aureliano, an enigmatic child destined to become Colonel Aureliano Buendía. The gypsies' return brings new technologies like ice, hailed by José Arcadio Buendía as the greatest invention of all time.</p>
    <p>The narrative shifts to explore the origins of José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula, their fear of having offspring with genetic deformities due to their kinship as cousins, and their journey to establish Macondo. After José Arcadio Buendía kills a rival who questions his virility, he and Úrsula leave the village and, after months of wandering, establish Macondo.</p>

    <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
    <p>The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.</p>
    <p>The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.</p>
    <p>Questions regarding the sexuality of characters have been raised for decades and—augmented by biographical details about the author—have given rise to queer readings.[217] During his lifetime, Fitzgerald's sexuality became a subject of debate among his friends and acquaintances.[218][219][220] As a youth, Fitzgerald had a close relationship with Father Sigourney Fay,[221] a possibly gay Catholic priest,[222][223] and Fitzgerald later used his last name for the idealized romantic character of Daisy Fay.[224] After college, Fitzgerald cross-dressed during outings in Minnesota.[225] Years later, while drafting The Great Gatsby, rumors dogged Fitzgerald among the American expat community in Paris that he was gay.[219] Soon after, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Fitzgerald likewise doubted his heterosexuality and asserted that he was a closeted homosexual.[226] She publicly belittled him with homophobic slurs,[227] and she alleged that Fitzgerald and fellow writer Ernest Hemingway engaged in homosexual relations.[228][229] These incidents strained the Fitzgeralds' marriage at the time of the novel's publication.</p>
