In the [CRC1313](https://www.sfb1313.uni-stuttgart.de/), we work on interface-driven multi-field processes in porous media. One of the cases that we are interested in is coupled free and porous-medium flow for which new coupling concepts and coupling conditions are evaluated and derived. We implement everything in the open-source simulator [DuMuX](https://dumux.org/) for which we also work on an adapter to make usage of preCICE even more convenient. The partitioned coupling approach and the C++ interface of preCICE allows us to conveniently couple the subproblems, even with non-trivial interfaces in 2D and 3D, while avoiding problems of commonly used monolithic approaches. This increases the flexibility to implement and evaluate different coupling conditions tremendously.
