We are developing a two-way-coupled solver for urban wind modelling where the simulation region is split into a region of interest, modelled by an in-house lattice Boltzmann solver run on GPU, and the remainder of the domain, modelled by the finite volume solver OpenFOAM. The hybrid model combines the characteristics of both solvers to produce an efficient tool for simulation of large-scale geometries with specific local regions of high interest. preCICE is an essential tool to enable the coupling of the two solvers due to its ease of use, robustness and open source community. preCICE provides clear documentation with step by step tutorials, different coupling and interpolation schemes and it requires only minimal modifications within the coupled codes.
